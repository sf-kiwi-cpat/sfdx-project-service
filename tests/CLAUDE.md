# tests/ — Agent-Mutable Quality Tools

These tests are owned by agents. Create, modify, and delete freely to
support implementation quality. They are not the contract — `spec/` is.

## Structure

- `tests/unit/` — Fast, isolated tests. Mocked dependencies.
- `tests/integration/` — Tests against the real Fastify app (via `inject()`).

Integration tests provide most of the coverage. Unit tests complement
them for edge cases and isolated logic.

## Coverage

Thresholds are in `vitest.config.ts`:
- **90%** on main (statements, functions, lines)
- **85%** on branches

Coverage must run against the **full test suite** (not unit-only):
```bash
npm run test:coverage    # all tests + coverage report
```

## Conventions

- Vitest (`describe`, `it`, `expect`)
- Import the app factory: `import { buildApp } from '../../src/app.js';`
- Use `app.inject()` for HTTP tests (no real server needed)
- Tests must be deterministic — no flaky tests, no timing dependencies
